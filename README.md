&emsp;&emsp; Greetings! I am currently an undergraduate student started from 2022 at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University [(XJTU)](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Bangyu Wu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/bangyuwu/home), working with Ph.D. student [Yisi Luo](https://yisiluo.github.io/).  I will pursue a master's degree at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University [(XJTU)]((https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/)) in 2026, supervised by Prof. [Deyu Meng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/dymeng). In July 2024, I will begin an internship at the Department of Oil and Gas Geophysics, CNPC Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development [(RIPED)](http://riped.cnpc.com.cn/riped2021/index.shtml). </p>

&emsp;&emsp; My research interests include implicit continuous representation and regularization for PDE-related forward and inverse problems, e.g., wave equation forward modeling, full waveform inversion (FWI).
